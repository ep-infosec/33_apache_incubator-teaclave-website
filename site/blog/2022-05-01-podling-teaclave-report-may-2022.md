## Teaclave

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  - Improve project structure and documentation
  - Grow the community (attracting more committers, contributors, users)
  - Publish Apache releases (resolving logistics on Apache release)

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

None.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

Since the last report, we have organized three monthly virtual
meetups. For each meetup, we have write-ups published on the Teaclave
blog.
