In April 29, we gathered in Zoom for the third monthly Teaclave meetup. In this
meetup, we're glad to have Jiang Jun from [Phala Network](https://phala.network/en/)
to give a talk on Taclave SGX SDK meets Substrate. Phala Network is a
decentralized confidential computing cloud with tech stack includes Teaclave SGX
SDK and Substrate.

In the meetup, we discuss use cases, technical details and implementation of
Phala Network, as well as some difficulties with current version of Teaclave SGX
SDK.

We are continuing work with out community together to improve the projects.
Hopefully, more users and developers can join in our community and share your
experience.
