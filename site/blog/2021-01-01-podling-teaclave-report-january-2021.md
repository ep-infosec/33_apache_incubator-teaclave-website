## Teaclave

Teaclave is a universal secure computing platform.

Teaclave has been incubating since 2019-08-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Improve project structure and documentation
  2. Grow the community (attracting more committers, contributors, users)
  3. Publish more Apache releases

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

None. 

### How has the community developed since the last report?

- We received contributions from a new external contributor.
- We found a new project using Teaclave SGX SDK called Veracruz, which is a
  framework for defining and deploying collaborative, privacy-preserving
  computations amongst a group of mutually mistrusting individuals.
- We summarized the community and projects powered by Teaclave and published
  a blog on our homepage.
- Rust TrustZone SDK will be accepted in Teaclave as a subproject. The community
  is discussing and voting the acceptance.
- The community has accepted a new committer.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

- Add PCA function in the builtin executor.
- Add exposed password checking function in the builtin executor.
- Add the attestation subcommand to display attestation report form the Intel
  attestation service.
- Add document to support deploying on Azure confidential computing VM.
