## Teaclave

Teaclave is a universal secure computing platform, making computation on
privacy-sensitive data safe and simple.

Teaclave has been incubating since 2019-08-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

- Improve project structure and documentation
- Grow the community (attracting more committers, contributors, users)
- Publish Apache releases (resolving logistics on Apache release)

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

None. 

### How has the community developed since the last report?

Since the last report, we have started monthly virtual meetups for three times.
Many people from the community share their usage experience of Teaclave. Also,
we invited some contributors to talk about some technical details of the design
and implementation. For each meetup, we have minutes write-up published on the
Teaclave blog.
  - Teaclave Meetup #1: <https://teaclave.apache.org/blog/2021-01-27-teaclave-meetup-1/>
  - Teaclave Meetup #2: <https://teaclave.apache.org/blog/2021-02-24-teaclave-meetup-2/>
  - Teaclave Meetup #3: <https://teaclave.apache.org/blog/2021-03-24-teaclave-meetup-3/>

In addition, we have one more project (Crust Network) powered by Teaclave joined
in our "Powered By" page on the Teaclave homepage.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

During this period, we also accepted the Rust OP-TEE TrustZone SDK project to
Teaclave as a sub-project, named as Teaclave TrustZone SDK. Similar to Teaclave
SGX SDK, Teaclave TrustZone SDK will be the foundation of the Teaclave FaaS
platform to support multiple trusted execution environments.

including built-in functions, SDKs in different languages, docker, command line
interface, documents, etc.
