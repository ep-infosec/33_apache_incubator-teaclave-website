## Teaclave

Teaclave is a universal secure computing platform, making computation on
privacy-sensitive data safe and simple.

Teaclave has been incubating since 2019-08-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Improve project structure and documentation
  2. Grow the community (attracting more committers, contributors, users)
  3. Publish Apache releases (resolving logistics on Apache release)

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

None. 

### How has the community developed since the last report?

Since the last report, we received contributions from a new contributor. We also
received many issue reports and questions regarding the usages, bugs, and
roadmap of Teaclave. Also, we presented the Teaclave project in recent ApacheCon
to the community and received some useful feedback.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

The main goal of development since the last report is to resolve logistics
towards the first Apache release. This includes license checking, building
system improvement, documentation and write-ups. On Oct 9th, the Teaclave
community and incubator has passed 0.1.0 release voting.

PPMC members election.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

Yes. They have been helpful and very responsive for the first public release.
